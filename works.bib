	Abstract = {Since their development in the late 1980s, cheap, reliable external cavity diode lasers (ECDLs) have replaced complex and expensive traditional dye and Titanium Sapphire lasers as the workhorse laser of atomic physics labs1,2. Their versatility and prolific use throughout atomic physics in applications such as absorption spectroscopy and laser cooling1,2 makes it imperative for incoming students to gain a firm practical understanding of these lasers. This publication builds upon the seminal work by Wieman3, updating components, and providing a video tutorial. The setup, frequency locking and performance characterization of an ECDL will be described. Discussion of component selection and proper mounting of both diodes and gratings, the factors affecting mode selection within the cavity, proper alignment for optimal external feedback, optics setup for coarse and fine frequency sensitive measurements, a brief overview of laser locking techniques, and laser linewidth measurements are included.},

@article{CALD-DAMA,
	Abstract = {Objectives This study quantifies the prevalence and rates of discharge against medical advice (DAMA) in culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) children and assesses the independent association between CALD status and DAMA accounting for key demographic confounders in a large tertiary Australian hospital network.Methods Prospectively collected data between 2010 and 2018 were extracted from the hospital network electronic medical records system for admitted patients (n=192 037), outpatients (n=268 904) and between 2015 and 2018 for emergency department (ED) patients (n=158 903). CALD status was defined as {\textquoteleft}preferred language being not English{\textquoteright} and DAMA was measured as {\textquoteleft}discharge at own risk{\textquoteright} in admissions, {\textquoteleft}no show{\textquoteright} in outpatients, {\textquoteleft}left without being seen{\textquoteright} and {\textquoteleft}did not wait{\textquoteright} in ED. Data were analysed using χ{\texttwosuperior} test, bivariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression.Results The prevalence of DAMA was 1.34\% in admitted patients, 19.31\% in outpatients and 12.64\% in ED patients. Rates of DAMA were higher among CALD children compared to non-CALD children (1.75\% vs 1.29\% in admitted patients, 26.53\% vs 17.92\% in outpatients and 18.74\% vs 11.61\% in ED patients). CALD status was independently associated with DAMA in admitted children (OR=1.30, 95\% CI 1.15 to 1.44), outpatients (OR=1.55; 95\% CI 1.51 to 1.58) and ED patients (OR=1.60; 95\% CI 1.53 to 1.66).Conclusion Being from a CALD background places children at increased risks to DAMA. Implementing appropriate health service responses may ensure equitable access and quality care for children from CALD backgrounds to reduce the rates of DAMA and its associated ramifications.},

@article{fish,
	Abstract = { In the wild, prey species often live in the vicinity of predators, rendering the ability to assess risk on a moment-to-moment basis crucial to survival. Visual cues are important as they allow prey to assess predator species, size, proximity and behaviour. However, few studies have explicitly examined prey's ability to assess risk based on predator behaviour and orientation. Using mosquitofish, Gambusia holbrooki, and their predator, jade perch, Scortum barcoo, under controlled conditions, we provide some of the first fine-scale characterization of how prey adapt their behaviour according to their continuous assessment of risk based on both predator behaviour and angular distance to the predator's mouth. When these predators were inactive and posed less of an immediate threat, prey within the attack cone of the predator showed reductions in speed and acceleration characteristic of predator-inspection behaviour. However, when predators became active, prey swam faster with greater acceleration and were closer together within the attack cone of predators. Most importantly, this study provides evidence that prey do not adopt a uniform response to the presence of a predator. Instead, we demonstrate that prey are capable of rapidly and dynamically updating their assessment of risk and showing fine-scale adjustments to their behaviour. },

@article{t3,
	Abstract = {Atom interferometers have been used to measure acceleration with at best a T2 scaling in sensitivity as the interferometer time T is increased. This limits the sensitivity to acceleration which is theoretically achievable by these configurations for a given frequency of acceleration. We predict and experimentally measure the acceleration-sensitive phase shift of a large-momentum-transfer atom interferometer based upon Bloch oscillations. Using this novel interferometric scheme we demonstrate an improved scaling of sensitivity which will scale as T3. This enhanced scaling will allow an increase in achievable sensitivity for any given frequency of an oscillatory acceleration signal, which will be of particular use for inertial and navigational sensors, and proposed gravitational wave detectors. A straightforward extension should allow a T4 scaling in acceleration sensitivity.},

@article{Kuhn_2014,
	Abstract = {This paper presents the first realization of a simultaneous 87Rb--85Rb Mach--Zehnder atom interferometer with Bose-condensed atoms. A number of ambitious proposals for precise terrestrial and space based tests of the weak equivalence principle rely on such a system. This implementation utilizes hybrid magnetic-optical trapping to produce spatially overlapped condensates with a repetition rate of 20 s. A horizontal optical waveguide with co-linear Bragg beamsplitters and mirrors is used to simultaneously address both isotopes in the interferometer. We observe a non--linear phase shift on a non-interacting 85Rb interferometer as a function of interferometer time, T, which we show arises from inter-isotope scattering with the co-incident 85Rb interferometer. A discussion of implications for future experiments is given.},

@article{Bennetts:s,
	Abstract = {Two simple external cavity diode laser designs using fibre pigtailed gain chips are tested and their properties compared with a high end DBR fibre laser. These ECDLs demonstrate a FWHM linewidth as low as 5.2kHz with a fitted Lorentzian FWHM linewidth as low as 1.6kHz. Tuning ranges of 200nm covering 1420nm to 1620nm were demonstrated. To the best of our knowledge these are the narrowest linewidth and most broadly tunable external cavity diode lasers reported to date. The improvement in linewidth is attributed to greatly enhanced acoustic isolation allowed by using fiber coupled gain chips and by replacing kinematic mounts with a pair of rotatable wedges for cavity alignment which eliminates acoustic resonances. A detailed description and discussion of techniques used to characterize the frequency noise and linewidths of these lasers is provided.},

@article{Altin_2013,
	Abstract = {We present a precision gravimeter based on coherent Bragg diffraction of freely falling cold atoms. Traditionally, atomic gravimeters have used stimulated Raman transitions to separate clouds in momentum space by driving transitions between two internal atomic states. Bragg interferometers utilize only a single internal state, and can therefore be less susceptible to environmental perturbations. Here we show that atoms extracted from a magneto-optical trap using an accelerating optical lattice are a suitable source for a Bragg atom interferometer, allowing efficient beamsplitting and subsequent separation of momentum states for detection. Despite the inherently multi-state nature of atom diffraction, we are able to build a Mach--Zehnder interferometer using Bragg scattering which achieves a sensitivity to the gravitational acceleration of Δg/g = 2.7 × 10−9 with an integration time of 1000 s. The device can also be converted to a gravity gradiometer by a simple modification of the light pulse sequence.},

	Abstract = {We compare the sensitivity of an interferometric measurement of gravity using a freely-falling, lasing atomic source to that achieved with a cold, thermal atomic source. We observe a higher fringe visibility with the lasing source, also the highest yet observed in such a configuration. We improve sensitivity by exploiting large momentum transfer beamsplitting (LMT), and discuss briefly the advantages of using a lasing atomic source for LMT. Most importantly, we measure no degradation of the sensitivity of our interferometer due to interaction induced dephasing at our limit of precision. Using a simple model, we verify this observation and project to beyond state-of-the-art sensitivities, concluding that with reasonable experimental parameters, interaction induced dephasing will not limit the sensitivity of inertial measurements using freely-falling, lasing atomic sources.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we theoretically investigate how the momentum width of an atomic source affects the efficiency of Bragg beam splitters and mirrors. We conclude that narrow momentum width sources, such as atom lasers, are significantly more efficient than atomic clouds with a larger momentum width, such as thermal sources, for high (but accessible) order Bragg processes. The development of large momentum transfer (LMT) mirrors and beam splitters is one of the most promising paths leading to increased precision in future sensors based on atom interferometry. This makes these results significant, because the signal to noise ratio of an interferometric measurement scales linearly with the momentum imparted in the beam splitting processes and scales as the square root of the atomic flux.},

13 065020), we presented the results from a Ramsey atom interferometer operating with an optically trapped sample of up to 106 Bose-condensed 87Rb atoms in the mF = 0 clock states. We were unable to observe projection noise fluctuations on the interferometer output, which we attribute to the stability of our microwave oscillator and background magnetic field. Numerical simulations of the Gross--Pitaevskii equations for our system show that dephasing due to spatial dynamics driven by interparticle interactions accounts for much of the observed decay in fringe visibility at long interrogation times. The simulations show good agreement with the experimental data when additional technical decoherence is accounted for, and suggest that the clock states are indeed immiscible. With smaller samples of 5 × 104 atoms, we observe a coherence time of τ = 1.0+0.5−0.3 s.},

@article{RateEquations,
	Abstract = {Different combinations and permutations of transcription factors work together to regulate the expression of target genes. These proteins often contain high levels of intrinsically disordered regions, which are important mediators of protein{\textendash}protein interactions. We show that unusual binding kinetics associated with an intrinsically disordered region in a transcriptional coregulator can regulate the formation of transcriptional complexes that lead to the specification of neuronal cell subtypes. Notably, a single intrinsically disordered region shows selective differences in binding kinetics for proteins of the same family, which have implications for how intrinsic disorder contributes to regulatory processes and complexity in higher organisms.Intrinsically disordered regions are highly represented among mammalian transcription factors, where they often contribute to the formation of multiprotein complexes that regulate gene expression. An example of this occurs with LIM-homeodomain (LIM-HD) proteins in the developing spinal cord. The LIM-HD protein LHX3 and the LIM-HD cofactor LDB1 form a binary complex that gives rise to interneurons, whereas in adjacent cell populations, LHX3 and LDB1 form a rearranged ternary complex with the LIM-HD protein ISL1, resulting in motor neurons. The protein{\textendash}protein interactions within these complexes are mediated by ordered LIM domains in the LIM-HD proteins and intrinsically disordered LIM interaction domains (LIDs) in LDB1 and ISL1; however, little is known about how the strength or rates of binding contribute to complex assemblies. We have measured the interactions of LIM:LID complexes using FRET-based protein{\textendash}protein interaction studies and EMSAs and used these data to model population distributions of complexes. The protein{\textendash}protein interactions within the ternary complexes are much weaker than those in the binary complex, yet surprisingly slow LDB1:ISL1 dissociation kinetics and a substantial increase in DNA binding affinity promote formation of the ternary complex over the binary complex in motor neurons. We have used mutational and protein engineering approaches to show that allostery and modular binding by tandem LIM domains contribute to the LDB1LID binding kinetics. The data indicate that a single intrinsically disordered region can achieve highly disparate binding kinetics, which may provide a mechanism to regulate the timing of transcriptional complex assembly.},
