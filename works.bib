	Abstract = {Precise measurement of physical quantities underpins much of modern science and tech- nology. Examples include length and time (satellite navigation), rotation and acceleration (guidance systems), electromagnetic (magnetic resonance imaging) and gravitational fields (mineral exploration). Currently, precision measurement of many physically and practically interesting quantities - such as the fine structure constant, the local gravitational field or any inertial acceleration - can be accomplished by atom interferometry [1]. Using cold atom interferometers may enable yet more precision, but this precision will be limited by atomic shot noise. Atomic shot noise, which is a fluctuation in the atomic density, arises because atoms are discrete. This fluctuation will affect precision when counting the atoms in a cloud, as is done in atomic interferometry. In this thesis, atomic shot noise was clearly and quantitatively measured in cold rubidium 87 atomic clouds using the absorption imaging technique. This was achieved by minimizing all possible sources of classical noise from the imaging setup, then binning the pixels together to overcome blurring effects. These blurring effects can be due to the velocity distribution of the atoms, the diffraction limit of the optical system, and the photon recoil in the measurement process itself. The tantalising possibility exists of measuring the shot noise on a Bose-Einstein condensate, and thereby gaining information on its quantum statistics. A scheme to produce and measure squeezing (a reduction in variance beyond the shot noise limit) in an atom laser beam will require a detector capable of measuring at the atomic shot noise limit, like the one devel- oped in this thesis. At the moment, applying this technique to measuring the shot noise on a BEC is limited by the size of the condensate and the resolution of the imaging system, but in principle it should be possible, as this thesis demonstrates. A full calibration of the experimental setup is performed.The application of this work to increasing the precision of cold atom interferometry is discussed.},

@phdthesis{phd-thesis,
	Abstract = {This thesis describes recent advances in ultra-cold atom interferometry. A common theme in the work described here is that the experiments are conducted on a Bose-Einstein condensate in an optical waveguide. This optical potential confines the atoms against gravity in the vertical dimension, guiding them to freely propagate along one horizontal dimension. Being supported against gravity enables long expansion times of hundreds of milliseconds, which facilitates techniques such as delta-kick cooling.

There are two main advantages of using ultra-cold atoms, rather than simply cold atoms, as a source for interferometry. Firstly, the coherence of an ensemble of atoms (as measured by either coherence length or coherence time) increases with a reduction in temperature. This means that a larger signal-to-noise may be obtained for a greater perturbation to ideal conditions, such as imperfect beam alignment, vibrations, intensity fluctuations etc. Conversely, this also means that such perturbations must be better understood so as to remove their systematic shift from a measurement of a quantity of interest. The second advantage to using an ultra-cold source cloud is its small size and small momentum width, as compared with a thermal source. Their small positional width means that clouds separated by only a small amount in momenta can easily be spatially separated and separately counted without the need for (magnetic) state labelling. Their small momentum width (and thus low spatial dispersion) means that better mode-matching is possible at the end of the interferometer, and that less-imperfect beam-splitter pulses are able to be used over the whole cloud.

The beamsplitters themselves would ideally impart a large momentum splitting between the interfering states as the signal of the interferometer is proportional to this splitting. The effective use of such a large momentum splitting, however, requires both an even narrower momentum width source and a system free of vibrations to at least a certain level. Otherwise such confounding factors can prevent any useful signal from being measured in such a device. Three such techniques were investigated in this thesis: reflection from a repulsive light potential barrier, Bragg transitions from an optical lattice (which are effectively bouncing atoms off a moving grating), and Bloch-acceleration by loading the atoms into such an optical lattice and then accelerating the combined system. It is found that a combination of both Bragg and Bloch provides the most promising route to truly large momentum transfer in a system which is sensitive only to acceleration. Lastly, large-momentum transfer techniques can be used to effectively increase the way in which the output signal scales with time, creating interferometers which generate the same sensitivity faster (increasing the bandwidth of a sensor), or generate a much better sensitivity in the same time.

The atom chosen for use in such a system depends largely upon what is easy to condense in a given lab, but it also depends upon which knobs one would like to be able to play with. A BEC of Rubidium-87 is comparatively easy to produce thanks to favourable collisional properties and the availability of diode lasers at the correct wavelength. However if one would like more control over the properties of the condensed cloud, including its collisional self-interaction strength, one must move to a different species. Conveniently also present in natural-abundance Rubidium sources, the collisional properties of Rubidium-85 can be modified by applying an external magnetic field, at an easy-to-experimentally-reach value of between 150-170G. Inconveniently, it is difficult (although not impossible) to condense by itself, so a sympathetic cooling technique in which 87Rb is used as an expendable coolant to acquire a cold sample of 85Rb is used in this thesis. This technique works surprisingly well thanks to yet more fortunate coincidences of the atomic properties of each atom. One benefit of requiring cold 87Rb to produce cold 85Rb is that it is easy to then produce a condensate of each species simultaneously in the same trap. It turns out that this combination of atomic isotopes is ideal for an interferometric test of the weak equivalence principle, one of the underpinnings of General Relativity. In fact, space missions are currently being proposed and funded on this combination of isotopes. This thesis also presents the results of the first Bose-condensed version of such a dual-species interferometer. As could well be expected, inter-atomic interactions play a large role in determining the output of such an interferometer and much further study is required before such a system could be deployed in space.

By ensuring there is no 87Rb left after condensation, we have created a pure 85Rb BEC. Using this we can now explore how the inter-atomic interactions affect the phase shift of a condensed atom interferometer, as we have complete control over the interaction strength. Two especially interesting cases are the following. Firstly, a condensate with no inter-particle interactions should not exhibit this effect at all, allowing a clean comparison point. Secondly, with a small attractive interaction between atoms, it is possible to create a self-trapped cloud of atoms which propagates dispersionlessly, even in the presence of a repulsive trapping potential. This cloud is known as a soliton, and it is predicted to have even more interesting quantum mechanical properties. For example it is predicted that by colliding two such solitons, an entangled state can be generated. Our results indicate that the dispersionless character of the soliton out-performs all other interaction strengths in an atom interferometer, including even the non-interacting cloud.

Throughout this thesis I have gained a better understanding of how ultra-cold atom interferometers work and what can be done to improve and extend their capabilities into new and exciting directions, and hopefully after reading this thesis, you will too.},

@article{DAMA,
	Abstract = {Background: Patients who discharge against medical advice (DAMA) from hospital carry a significant risk of readmission and have increased rates of morbidity and mortality. We sought to identify the demographic and clinical characteristics of DAMA patients from a tertiary paediatric hospital. Methods: Data were extracted retrospectively from electronic medical records for all inpatient admissions over a 5-year period. Demographic characteristics (age, sex, Aboriginality, socioeconomic status and remoteness of residence) and clinical characteristics (admitting hospital site, level of urgency on admission, diagnosis and previous DAMA) were extracted and logistic regression models were used to identify predictors of DAMA with 95% confidence intervals. Results: There were 246,359 admissions for 124,757 patients, of which 1871 (0.8%) admissions and 1730 patients (1.4%) DAMA. Predictors of DAMA in a given admission were hospital site (OR 4.8, CI 4.2&ndash;5.7, p &lt; 0.01), a mental health/behavioural diagnosis (OR 3.3, CI 2.2&ndash;4.8, p &lt; 0.01), Aboriginality (OR 1.6, CI 1.3&ndash;2.1, p &lt; 0.01), emergency rather than elective admissions (OR 0.7ha, CI 0.6&ndash;0.8, p &lt; 0.01), a gastrointestinal diagnosis (OR 1.5, CI 1.1&ndash;2.0, p = 0.04) and a history of previous DAMA (OR 2.0, CI 1.2&ndash;3.2, p = 0.05). Conclusions: There are clear predictors of DAMA in this tertiary hospital admission cohort and identification of these provides opportunities for intervention at a practice and policy level in order to prevent adverse outcomes.},

@article{CALD-DAMA,
	Abstract = {Objectives This study quantifies the prevalence and rates of discharge against medical advice (DAMA) in culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) children and assesses the independent association between CALD status and DAMA accounting for key demographic confounders in a large tertiary Australian hospital network.Methods Prospectively collected data between 2010 and 2018 were extracted from the hospital network electronic medical records system for admitted patients (n=192 037), outpatients (n=268 904) and between 2015 and 2018 for emergency department (ED) patients (n=158 903). CALD status was defined as preferred language being not English and DAMA was measured as discharge at own risk in admissions, no show in outpatients, left without being seen and did not wait in ED. Data were analysed using Chi-squared test, bivariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression.Results The prevalence of DAMA was 1.3% in admitted patients, 19.3% in outpatients and 12.6% in ED patients. Rates of DAMA were higher among CALD children compared to non-CALD children (1.75% vs 1.29% in admitted patients, 26.53% vs 17.92% in outpatients and 18.7% vs 11.6% in ED patients). CALD status was independently associated with DAMA in admitted children (OR=1.30, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.44), outpatients (OR=1.55; 95% CI 1.51 to 1.58) and ED patients (OR=1.60; 95% CI 1.53 to 1.66).Conclusion Being from a CALD background places children at increased risks to DAMA. Implementing appropriate health service responses may ensure equitable access and quality care for children from CALD backgrounds to reduce the rates of DAMA and its associated ramifications.},

@article{fish,
	Abstract = { In the wild, prey species often live in the vicinity of predators, rendering the ability to assess risk on a moment-to-moment basis crucial to survival. Visual cues are important as they allow prey to assess predator species, size, proximity and behaviour. However, few studies have explicitly examined prey's ability to assess risk based on predator behaviour and orientation. Using mosquitofish, Gambusia holbrooki, and their predator, jade perch, Scortum barcoo, under controlled conditions, we provide some of the first fine-scale characterization of how prey adapt their behaviour according to their continuous assessment of risk based on both predator behaviour and angular distance to the predator's mouth. When these predators were inactive and posed less of an immediate threat, prey within the attack cone of the predator showed reductions in speed and acceleration characteristic of predator-inspection behaviour. However, when predators became active, prey swam faster with greater acceleration and were closer together within the attack cone of predators. Most importantly, this study provides evidence that prey do not adopt a uniform response to the presence of a predator. Instead, we demonstrate that prey are capable of rapidly and dynamically updating their assessment of risk and showing fine-scale adjustments to their behaviour. },

	Abstract = {Atom interferometers have been used to measure acceleration with at best a T2 scaling in sensitivity as the interferometer time T is increased. This limits the sensitivity to acceleration which is theoretically achievable by these configurations for a given frequency of acceleration. We predict and experimentally measure the acceleration-sensitive phase shift of a large-momentum-transfer atom interferometer based upon Bloch oscillations. Using this novel interferometric scheme we demonstrate an improved scaling of sensitivity which will scale as T3. This enhanced scaling will allow an increase in achievable sensitivity for any given frequency of an oscillatory acceleration signal, which will be of particular use for inertial and navigational sensors, and proposed gravitational wave detectors. A straightforward extension should allow a T4 scaling in acceleration sensitivity.},

Here we show that atoms extracted from a magneto-optical trap using an accelerating optical lattice are a suitable source for a Bragg atom interferometer, allowing efficient beamsplitting and subsequent separation of momentum states for detection. Despite the inherently multi-state nature of atom diffraction, we are able to build a Mach--Zehnder interferometer using Bragg scattering which achieves a sensitivity to the gravitational acceleration of Δg/g = 2.7 × 10−9 with an integration time of 1000 s.

	Abstract = {We compare the sensitivity of an interferometric measurement of gravity using a freely-falling, lasing atomic source to that achieved with a cold, thermal atomic source. We observe a higher fringe visibility with the lasing source, also the highest yet observed in such a configuration. We improve sensitivity by exploiting large momentum transfer beamsplitting (LMT), and discuss briefly the advantages of using a lasing atomic source for LMT. Most importantly, we measure no degradation of the sensitivity of our interferometer due to interaction induced dephasing at our limit of precision. Using a simple model, we verify this observation and project to beyond state-of-the-art sensitivities, concluding that with reasonable experimental parameters, interaction induced dephasing will not limit the sensitivity of inertial measurements using freely-falling, lasing atomic sources.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we theoretically investigate how the momentum width of an atomic source affects the efficiency of Bragg beam splitters and mirrors. We conclude that narrow momentum width sources, such as atom lasers, are significantly more efficient than atomic clouds with a larger momentum width, such as thermal sources, for high (but accessible) order Bragg processes. The development of large momentum transfer (LMT) mirrors and beam splitters is one of the most promising paths leading to increased precision in future sensors based on atom interferometry. This makes these results significant, because the signal to noise ratio of an interferometric measurement scales linearly with the momentum imparted in the beam splitting processes and scales as the square root of the atomic flux.},

13 065020), we presented the results from a Ramsey atom interferometer operating with an optically trapped sample of up to 106 Bose-condensed 87Rb atoms in the mF = 0 clock states. We were unable to observe projection noise fluctuations on the interferometer output, which we attribute to the stability of our microwave oscillator and background magnetic field. Numerical simulations of the Gross--Pitaevskii equations for our system show that dephasing due to spatial dynamics driven by interparticle interactions accounts for much of the observed decay in fringe visibility at long interrogation times. The simulations show good agreement with the experimental data when additional technical decoherence is accounted for, and suggest that the clock states are indeed immiscible. With smaller samples of 5 × 104 atoms, we observe a coherence time of τ = 1.0+0.5−0.3 s.},

Our results indicate that, with further experimental refinements, it will be possible to produce and measure the output of a sub-shot-noise-limited, large atom number BEC-based interferometer. The optical trap allows us to couple the |F=1,  mF=0⟩→|F=2,  mF=0⟩ clock states using a single photon 6.8 GHz microwave transition, while state selective readout is achieved with absorption imaging. We analyse the process of absorption imaging and show that it is possible to observe atom number variance directly, with a signal-to-noise ratio ten times better than the atomic projection noise limit on 106 condensate atoms. We discuss the technical and fundamental noise sources that limit our current system, and present theoretical and experimental results on interferometer contrast, de-phasing and miscibility.},

The visibility and contrast of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) and three thermal sources with varying spatial coherence are compared as a function of interferometer time. At short times, the fringe visibility of a BEC source approaches 100% nearly independent of π pulse efficiency, while thermal sources have fringe visibilities limited to the π pulse efficiency. More importantly for precision measurement systems, the BEC source maintains interference at interferometer times significantly beyond the thermal source.},

@article{RateEquations,
	Abstract = {Different combinations and permutations of transcription factors work together to regulate the expression of target genes. These proteins often contain high levels of intrinsically disordered regions, which are important mediators of protein{\textendash}protein interactions. We show that unusual binding kinetics associated with an intrinsically disordered region in a transcriptional coregulator can regulate the formation of transcriptional complexes that lead to the specification of neuronal cell subtypes. Notably, a single intrinsically disordered region shows selective differences in binding kinetics for proteins of the same family, which have implications for how intrinsic disorder contributes to regulatory processes and complexity in higher organisms.Intrinsically disordered regions are highly represented among mammalian transcription factors, where they often contribute to the formation of multiprotein complexes that regulate gene expression. An example of this occurs with LIM-homeodomain (LIM-HD) proteins in the developing spinal cord. The LIM-HD protein LHX3 and the LIM-HD cofactor LDB1 form a binary complex that gives rise to interneurons, whereas in adjacent cell populations, LHX3 and LDB1 form a rearranged ternary complex with the LIM-HD protein ISL1, resulting in motor neurons. The protein{\textendash}protein interactions within these complexes are mediated by ordered LIM domains in the LIM-HD proteins and intrinsically disordered LIM interaction domains (LIDs) in LDB1 and ISL1; however, little is known about how the strength or rates of binding contribute to complex assemblies. We have measured the interactions of LIM:LID complexes using FRET-based protein{\textendash}protein interaction studies and EMSAs and used these data to model population distributions of complexes. The protein{\textendash}protein interactions within the ternary complexes are much weaker than those in the binary complex, yet surprisingly slow LDB1:ISL1 dissociation kinetics and a substantial increase in DNA binding affinity promote formation of the ternary complex over the binary complex in motor neurons. We have used mutational and protein engineering approaches to show that allostery and modular binding by tandem LIM domains contribute to the LDB1LID binding kinetics. The data indicate that a single intrinsically disordered region can achieve highly disparate binding kinetics, which may provide a mechanism to regulate the timing of transcriptional complex assembly.},

BEC is typically created with an exponential evaporation ramp that is optimal for ergodic dynamics with two-body s-wave interactions and no other loss rates, but likely sub-optimal for real experiments. Through repeated machine-controlled scientific experimentation and observations our `learner' discovers an optimal evaporation ramp for BEC production. In contrast to previous work, our learner uses a Gaussian process to develop a statistical model of the relationship between the parameters it controls and the quality of the BEC produced. We demonstrate that the Gaussian process machine learner is able to discover a ramp that produces high quality BECs in 10 times fewer iterations than a previously used online optimization technique. Furthermore, we show the internal model developed can be used to determine which parameters are essential in BEC creation and which are unimportant, providing insight into the optimization process of the system.},
